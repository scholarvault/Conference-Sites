## 2024-04-24 - HTML Injection Vulnerability in Email Templates
**Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input was being directly injected into email templates across multiple Vercel Edge functions (`send-email.ts`), leading to potential HTML injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via email clients.
**Learning:** Directly passing unvalidated API request data (e.g., user names) into string-templated HTML emails risks execution of malicious payload, impacting both users receiving emails and admins if reviewing these inputs.
**Prevention:** Always ensure an `escapeHtml` function is used for string properties in payload data before feeding them into email rendering functions.
