## 2026-08-22 - Unoptimized Render Loops
**Learning:** Continuous `requestAnimationFrame` loops on canvas elements and 3D UI elements run even when out of view or not interacting with them. This causes unnecessary continuous CPU/GPU usage, draining battery and affecting scroll performance on slower devices.
**Action:** Always use `IntersectionObserver` to pause off-screen animations, and make sure that interaction-driven animations only render when interacting and settling to the final position.
